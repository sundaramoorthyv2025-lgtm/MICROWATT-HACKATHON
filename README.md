# Smart Clock Management for Microwatt
*Dynamic Frequency Scaling (DFS) and Clock Gating for Energy-Efficient OpenPOWER Core*

## Project Description
This project explores the integration of smart clock management techniques into the open-source Microwatt processor. The main idea is to introduce Dynamic Frequency Scaling (DFS), which allows the processor to operate at multiple clock frequencies depending on workload demands, and clock gating, which reduces dynamic power by disabling inactive functional units. These techniques aim to make Microwatt more adaptive and energy-efficient while providing a practical platform to study low-power design strategies in open-source hardware.

By adding DFS and clock gating, this project bridges the gap between educational processor cores and modern power-aware design principles commonly used in industry. It allows researchers, students, and hardware enthusiasts to experiment with energy-efficient techniques in a fully open-source PowerISA environment. The project also sets the stage for potential applications in IoT and embedded systems where energy efficiency is critical.

## Project Proposal

### Problem Statement
Modern processors, including educational open-source cores like Microwatt, consume dynamic power continuously due to constant clock activity, even when portions of the processor are idle. This leads to unnecessary energy consumption, which is critical in low-power and embedded applications. Currently, Microwatt operates at a fixed frequency without adaptive clock control or fine-grained clock gating.

### Objective
The objective is to enhance Microwatt with a Smart Clock Management Unit (CMU) that:
1. Supports multiple clock frequencies via Dynamic Frequency Scaling (DFS).
2. Implements clock gating to disable inactive pipeline stages.
3. Provides a software-controllable interface to adjust clock frequency and gating.

### Expected Outcomes
- A conceptual design of a Smart Clock Management Unit integrated with Microwatt.
- Demonstration of how DFS and clock gating improve energy efficiency.
- A reference platform for studying low-power techniques in open-source processor designs.
- Documentation and diagrams explaining the design and its benefits.

### Significance
This project will provide the open-source hardware community with a practical example of energy-efficient processor design, bridging academic and industrial approaches. It will demonstrate how modern power management techniques can be implemented in lightweight, open-source processors, supporting further research and development in energy-aware computing.
